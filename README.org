Join me in my adventures to migrate from Vim to Emacs' [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil]] side.

This will probably be a lengthy process and it is now in early stages.
I am currently experimenting with a lot of plugins to create a decent
config.

I've used parts of [[https://github.com/diegolascasas/.emacs.d][diegolascasas/.emacs.d]] as a starting point.
It's the most well organized Emacs config I've seen.

This is how it looks so far:

* Introduction

Vim was so much more attractive to me than Emacs. Allow me to explain.

When I first got in contact with vim and saw vertical selection in action,
my mind was blown. I thought to myself I was using the most powerful
editor of all time.

At one point between then and now, there I was with about 5 or 6 terminal
windows open at the same time. I then realized there was something
wrong with that setup.

That's when I found Tmux. After weeks of trying to come up with the perfect
config for me, two problems bothered me to no end: Lack of copy/paste
integration with X and C-c'ing out of programs. The first problem was solved
through xclip (still not intuitive). The second problem, though, I never got
anywhere hacking it.

I've always been curious about Emacs, but never got around learning it.
Everyone said that I was well served with either one of them, vim and Emacs.
That's where they were wrong. Emacs and Evil mode have so far shown me
the best of those two worlds.

I'm now giving Emacs a chance to show it's usefulness. And so far, I'm
very impressed.
